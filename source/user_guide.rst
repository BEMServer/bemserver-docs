Basic concepts

The high-level entity for a project is the campaign. A campaign may span on
several sites and buildings. It has beginning and end dates, although the end
date may be left open to let the campaign last indefinitely.

Users are associated to user groups. User groups provide access to campaigns.

Timeseries and events data in a campaign may be split into separate scopes.
Campaign scopes are used to organize data and to provide more fine-grained
permissions.
